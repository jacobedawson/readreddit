        <h3 class="text-left">What's In The Newsletter?</h3>
        <p>The weekly Reddreader newsletter contains all of the books that were featured during the week, collected automatically and then filtered manually just in case any robot weirdness sneaks in there ðŸ¤–. If there's time I'll add in an introduction / additional info for each book, and in the next phase I'd like to add additional ratings / comments on the book to flesh out the context.<br><br>
        The newsletter arrives just once a week, and hopefully you'll find it useful to help keep your bookcase filled to the brim.<br><br>ðŸ“š Fill me up, Chandler!</p>
